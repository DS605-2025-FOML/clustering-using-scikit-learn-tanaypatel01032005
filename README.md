# Lab 6: Clustering Algorithms

## Overview
This lab introduces students to unsupervised learning through clustering algorithms. We explore three fundamental clustering techniques using the famous Iris dataset.

Today's Motivation:
    
    "Every small step today builds the success of tomorrow" - Dhruv Panchal

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of unsupervised learning and clustering
- Learn to implement and compare different clustering algorithms
- Master data preprocessing techniques for clustering
- Evaluate clustering performance using appropriate metrics
- Gain hands-on experience with parameter tuning

## Dataset
**Iris Dataset**: A classic dataset in machine learning containing 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm) 
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

The dataset includes 3 species of iris flowers:
- Setosa (50 samples)
- Versicolor (50 samples)
- Virginica (50 samples)

## Algorithms Covered

### 1. K-Means Clustering
- **Principle**: Partition data into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster sum of squares
- **Use case**: Spherical clusters of similar sizes
- **Key parameters**: Number of clusters (k)
- **Evaluation**: Elbow method for optimal k selection

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
- **Principle**: Build a hierarchy of clusters using bottom-up (agglomerative) approach
- **Use case**: Exploring cluster structure and dendrograms
- **Key parameters**: Linkage criteria, distance metric
- **Advantage**: No need to specify number of clusters beforehand

### 3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
- **Principle**: Find clusters based on density of data points
- **Use case**: Clusters of arbitrary shapes, outlier detection
- **Key parameters**: eps (neighborhood radius), min_samples (minimum points in neighborhood)
- **Advantage**: Automatically determines number of clusters and identifies outliers

## Key Concepts

### Data Preprocessing
- **Standardization**: Essential for clustering algorithms to ensure all features contribute equally
- **Feature scaling**: Prevents features with larger scales from dominating the clustering process

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: Measures similarity between true and predicted clusters
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster vs. other clusters
- **Inertia (WCSS)**: Within-cluster sum of squares for K-Means evaluation

### Parameter Tuning
- **K-Means**: Use elbow method to find optimal number of clusters
- **DBSCAN**: Experiment with eps and min_samples to find appropriate density thresholds
- **Cross-validation**: Important for parameter selection in clustering

## Lab Structure

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load Iris dataset and understand its structure
2. **Data Visualization**: Create pairplots and boxplots to understand data distribution
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize features for clustering algorithms
4. **Algorithm Implementation**: Apply K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare algorithms using ARI and Silhouette scores
6. **Exercises**: Hands-on practice with parameter tuning and feature selection
